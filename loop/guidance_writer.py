"""Adaptive guidance beside the search: the adaptive arm.

Every K candidates (--every) the run's records are summarised, one capped Gemini
call writes a short guidance paragraph from them, and the driver, started with
--guidance <file>, puts the file into the prompt of every later proposal. The file
holds facts the fixed prompt cannot know, written without a model call (the words
accepted this run with their declarations, so they are reused and not redefined;
the refusals among the last K candidates by reason), and the model's paragraph
(what paid off, the largest remaining mistake where there is headroom, what to
stop doing, where a new word would help). If the call fails the facts are
rewritten and the last paragraph stands. Every version, its summary and the raw
reply are kept under <out dir>/guidance/, one line per version goes to
guidance.jsonl, and a restart resumes from that log.

You advise an agent that evolves last-level-cache replacement policies for
ChampSim (the DPC4 single-core LLC: 4096 sets, 12 ways, no prefetcher) as
structure descriptions in a fixed vocabulary plus new words it may declare. Its
score is, on each training trace, the design's IPC over Mockingjay's IPC on the
same trace, as a geometric mean over the traces: the seed, Mockingjay, scores 1.0
and above 1.0 beats it. For its parent design it sees per-trace IPC, LLC MPKI, the
OPT headroom (the share of sampled misses Belady's MIN would avoid) and four
kinds of mistake judged against MIN: {'; '.join(f'{k}: {v}' for k, v in MEANS.items())}.
Below are the facts of the run so far. Write the guidance for its next proposals
as one paragraph of at most {PARAGRAPH_WORDS} words of plain prose: no heading, no
list, no format or syntax rules. Every sentence follows from the facts; name the
traces, the parts of the design and the mistake classes you mean, and invent no
number. Say which kinds of change paid off and which lost; the largest remaining
mistake on the traces with the most headroom and what kind of change (what the
policy remembers, how it decides) would address it; what to stop doing; and where
a new word would express something the vocabulary cannot. Name no paper,
published policy or technique from outside this run: draw only on these facts
and on the five designs the agent is shown (LRU, SRRIP, DRRIP, SHiP and the
seed, Mockingjay). Reply with the paragraph alone."""
